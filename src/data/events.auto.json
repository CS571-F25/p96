This will be a low-stress, low-pressure space with gentle movement and plenty of flexibility to participate in whatever way feels comfortable for you. No yoga experience is required, and you are encouraged to take breaks, modify poses, stim, or just hang out and enjoy the calm atmosphere. The goal is to create a supportive, judgment-free space to move your body, unwind, and connect.",
